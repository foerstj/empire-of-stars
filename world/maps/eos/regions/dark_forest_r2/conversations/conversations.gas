Once you've paid your respects, you'll be wanting to visit Lang, I'll bet. You're a fair ways off the main path, but you can rejoin it if you follow the eastern trail here and take the south fork into the hills. I've still got some work to do cleaning up the old Displacer Platform, so run along now and keep your eyes out for bandits in the trees. They're as bold as wolves these days, I'm afraid. ";
