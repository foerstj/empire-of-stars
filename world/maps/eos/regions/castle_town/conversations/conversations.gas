We all live in relative harmony for centuries. Well, as it is, with some races and tribes, living in harmony basically means each side minding their own business...
Sadly there are no True Agallans here currently; well, it's off-season, of course. When they come they usually camp in tents, as the rooms here are too small for them naturally. They're quite a sight, especially from our perspective!";
