Hahaha! You fool! Now the Reptiloids will roam the stars again, and your home Aranna will be the first to fall under the dominion of Seth!
What, you want to fight me? Hehe. We'll see about that, come on, draw your weapons. Seeing you managed to break into La Crimosa, you will be a fun enemy to kill. Besides, even if you managed to kill me, it would make no difference. You see, the real head of the Seth is our Queen Mother. She breeds the Seth, and our sisters the Drakes, and other Horrid things, and will breed a new King in time.
So come now, fight a worthless battle, and die knowing your home will soon be no more!";
