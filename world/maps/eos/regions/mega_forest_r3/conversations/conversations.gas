So listen closely now, while I tell you all I know about the forest, and make sure to remember it all, so you will find the way back.";

South of here, there is a rift in the ground. It starts just south of here and continues towards the east. So if you get lost and find a rift, walk to its west end and then turn north... you get the idea.
At the eastern end of that rift is a bright green meadow, and east of that there's another giant tree somewhere. And if you're stupid enough to walk even further, far in the east from here there's reportedly a lake.

The most interesting part is probably the north/northeast. But be careful, there's not only the other tribe of Guliks, but also dangerous beasts like Mantraps, and in the far north there live the Braak.
Basically straight northeast from here is a place where two giant trees grow on both sides of a river. Past that is the Gulik camp. North from the Gulik camp is another lake, this one has Syrrus in it. West from the Syrrus lake is a larger field of ruins, and further northwest from there, basically straight north from here, there are two Braak nests.
So if you find two giant trees, or a Syrrus lake, or a field of ruins, turn southwest to find back; and if you find the Braak, go straight south.

Good luck and happy hunting! Hope to see you again!";
