While Geb is blessed with eternal sunshine, and bright stars at night, Ixchel is always shrouded in clouds that rain almost constantly. A rather unpleasant planet, if you ask me.";

When the Empire crumbled we were also the first ones to withdraw from the whole thing and let the humans fight their internecine wars among themselves.";

One of our ancient sagas tell about a Droog colony in an Arannan province. To be honest it seems like it was a sort of prison - wrongdoers were expelled from Geb for a while, and of course they didn't want to serve their time on Ixchel. When we broke off from the Empire, it seems they were simply left to their own fate. The saga spends a hundred verses singing about how reckless that was and how much guilt the ancient rulers have laden upon all of us...";

The smaller pad connects us to Ixchel, and it doesn't require any Starstone - when the system was built, the Droog insisted on this. We don't use it often - sometimes young Mudheads come looking around, be amazed by the stars at night, get a sunburn the next day, and return home, haha.
If you want to search for this ancient Starstone artifact, I can recommend you where to look: in the Pyramid. It's far out in the shrubs, however, and the shrubs are endless and wayless. The easiest way to find the Pyramid would be by finding the Golden Lion first. It's straight to the south from here - you can't miss it - go south, and then follow the eyes of the black cats. The eyes of the Lion will then point you directly to the Pyramid to the east.
Good luck! And beware of the Sand Imps, and especially of the savage Droog living out there! They will not like you strange creatures invading their territory. They'll most probably attack you. Buy some good weapons in our stores before you go.";
