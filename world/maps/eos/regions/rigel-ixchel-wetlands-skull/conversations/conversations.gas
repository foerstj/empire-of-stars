My name is Necahual, I work at the potion shop ahead. I was alone when the Savages came - I had to run, and was able to barricade myself in here. If you can free it, help yourself to any potions you find there!
And greet my sister Ah-Cun-Can in Orionis, she's probably worried about me. Tell her I'm fine. I'm not hurt and there are provisions in this shack.";
