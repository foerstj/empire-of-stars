## Gameplay
Welcome to the map, and thanks for playing!

A few notes:
- You need to have starstones to operate the teleporters. This was implemented using the "has game object in inventory" check. This check is *very* permissive - it works as long as any party member has the item in their inventory, and once it's activated it stays active (you could theoretically throw away used starstones).\
  However there's one gotcha: the starstone needs to be directly in the inventory - it doesn't work if it's inside a backpack! (My guess is that this check was implemented for DS1 and not refined for LoA.)
- If you're the kind of player who likes to "do the whole area": Please DON'T try to do this on Rigel-Geb! The Endless Shrubland is huge, and stitched in a loop in all directions (much like the Endless Desert on the Utraean Peninsula). The whole area was auto-generated (plants and enemies) and there is nothing special or secret to be found anywhere out there, it's all just more of the same. And when you finished clearing it, you'll probably be overpowered and bored for the rest of the map.\
  A second reason not to go crazy out in the Endless Shrubland is that bugs have been observed, especially if you leave some characters (e.g. mules) at the oasis and "loop around" with your main party. Terrain stitches might fail to load, the overview map might look broken etc.. If you encounter such bugs I recommend teleporting out & in again.
- This map is intended to be "open world". As you find new starstones, new parts of the map open up to you; towards the end it closes in again as you approach the place where the Aranna starstone is waiting for you.\
  The middle of the map (after you found Aunt Luna on Betelgeuse) is a bit of a treasure hunt where you search for starstones until you find the one that brings the storyline forward again. So if you feel a bit disoriented after Betelgeuse - don't worry, you're not lost ;)
