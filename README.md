This release includes Alpha Centauri, Vega, Betelgeuse, Altair and Rigel from the 0.5 release and several new regions:
- The town of Iliyuna on Aldebaran.\
  Discover a part of the Empire of Stars still in existence: the town of Iliyuna, which once formed the Empire's twin capital together with Iliyara on Aranna. Hire Half-Giant 10th Legion guards, and explore the town and the ruins of the Palace of Light.
- The planetary ring.\
  Walk around in space and smash some shards for fun!
- The teleport asteroid of Sirius.\
  Nothing there yet except for the Aranna Starstone. Tbh just wanted to get the interstellar hub finished.

Miscellaneous:
- New enemies were made for planet Agalla as well as the planetary ring (simple re-textures & re-stats).
- Legionnaire Robe was added for the hireable 10th Legion mages.
- Additions to the Astral item set: shield & a ring - now 18 items altogether.
- Lots of lore books to explore in the lore lib of the palace ruins.
- Wise Tretch added on Vega, supposed to provide a little guidance.
- More small changes, of course.
