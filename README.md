## Release 0.7: Shit is getting Sirius

This release includes Alpha Centauri, Vega, Betelgeuse, Altair, Rigel and Aldebaran from the 0.6 release and several new regions:
- The Bandit Moon.\
  Fight the savage Bandits in this picturesque forest.
- The Machine Moon.\
  Turn this bunch of bots into a scrapyard.
- The Death Moon.\
  Hack and slash through the horde of rotting flesh.

Miscellaneous:
- New enemies were made mostly for the Death Moon (simple re-textures & re-stats). Textures of gray zombie wolves and brown ursae are courtesy of Eksevis' Halloween Mod.
- Each of the three moons has a quest to find and destroy a Dark Generator located there. You need to destroy all three Dark Generators to be able to teleport to the planet. You can test the condition, but the "planet" is just a dummmy region to be implemented in the next release.
- On each moon you can find one friendly soul to talk to. They all ask you to kill the Seth King. This will be made into a quest in the next release.
- More small changes, of course.
