Discover the Real Truth about the Empire of *STARS*!

On this map, you discover that the ancient Empire of Stars was actually an interstellar civilization, connecting distant star systems with powerful teleporters. Travel to other planets, meet lost parts of the Empire, find your missing aunt, and search for a way back home!

## Usage
Welcome to the repo. For editing, the repo checkout is supposed to be your "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Dungeon Siege LoA\Bits" folder.

For building & running the map, you can use the /run.bat. It's supposed to be called from your DS installation folder, and TankCreator is supposed to be next to it. I hope it works for you; if not, regard it as "documentation as code".

## Region Overview
Here's an overview of the regions, with some basic info for quick reference.

Most regions were imported from the original maps KoE, UP & LoA. I had scripts making sure node IDs are unique and to convert DS1 regions to use the LoA node mesh index.
