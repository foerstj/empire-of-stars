# Empire of Stars

A little map for Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna.

\- ANCIENT ALIENS -\
Discover the Real Truth about the Empire of *STARS*!

On this map, you discover that the ancient Empire of Stars was actually an interstellar civilization, connecting distant star systems with powerful teleporters. Travel to other planets, meet lost parts of the Empire, find your missing aunt, and search for a way back home!

## Release 0.2

This release includes Little Iliyara Island from the 0.1 release and several new regions:
- The main campaign of Alpha Centauri.\
This part is admittedly rather derivative. From the village of Eddiloo, you set out through the forest into the crypt.
- Alpha Centauri Moon, where you can do some hunting and looting.
- Aranna Moon, where the Magic Moon Dwarves live in a Tavern.

Note:\
The Alpha Centauri campaign is rather easy right now, because you can add Aunt Luna to your party.
In a later release she will be placed on a different planet.
