## Release 0.3: A Utraean Utopia

This release includes Alpha Centauri from the 0.2 release and several new regions:
- The main campaign of Betelgeuse.\
On this paradisiacal planet under a pink sun, you travel through a forest of flowers to seek out the Elder of the Lake for answers.
- Betelgeuse Moon, which offers stunning landscape with easy enemies.
- The first part of the dense jungle of Vega, where you can go for hunting.

Miscellaneous:
- A new item set was created, "The Astral Set". You can find up to 6 set items.
- Black water for Lake Chalice at the start.
- Some new enemies & ambients (simple re-textures & re-stats).
- The map features some innocent nudity in the Utraean society.\
  Planning on supporting a non-nude overlay dsres but tbh graphics is ridiculously primitive.
- More small changes, of course.
