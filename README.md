# Empire of Stars

A little map for Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna.

\- ANCIENT ALIENS -\
Discover the Real Truth about the Empire of *STARS*!

On this map, you discover that the ancient Empire of Stars was actually an interstellar civilization, connecting distant star systems with powerful teleporters. Travel to other planets, meet lost parts of the Empire, find your missing aunt, and search for a way back home!

## Release 0.4: Ice & Fire

This release includes Alpha Centauri, Vega and Betelgeuse from the 0.3 release and several new regions:
- The snowy landscape of Altair.\
Meet the dwarves in the cozy town of Lagomsnö and walk through the Winternight Woods.
- The Fireheart Caverns, volcanic caves deep below the surface, inhabited by Zaurask and other creatures.
- The Ice Moon of Altair, which is so cold that nothing but ice exists there.
- The second part of the jungle of Vega, with some more Pygmies (Guliks & Bookas) and also stronger enemies like the Mantraps and the Jungle Braak. Located north-east of the teleporter.

Miscellaneous:
- Each of these four areas contains new enemies (simple re-textures & re-stats).
- Additions to the Astral item set - now already 11 items altogether.
- Lagomsnö is ASCII-ized to Lagomsno in-game because DS kept behaving strangely. Correct spelling will at least be available in the German translation that I'll add one distant day.
- More small changes, of course.
