Granted, the ruins are nothing compared to the main island - but I have found something astounding here... I might be so close to solving an ancient mystery, and, you know me, I can hardly sleep from the goosebumps it gives me. I will write you more about it when I have had more time to examine it.\n\nUntil then - take care,\nWith greetings & kisses, your one and only Aunt Luna";

While there are to this day descendants of these magicians of the First Age living on the Utraean Island west of Aranna, also they have lost the knowledge about how these platforms have once been built. The Utraeans of antiquity are the only people known for having built such platforms, although it must be said that our knowledge of the olden days is limited, and probably always will be.\n\nWhile the inner workings of the platform remain enigmatic, my research lets me conclude that there is one element they all have in common: a small mysterious crystal of unknown material, of about the size of a pinhead, that can be found embedded in all of these platforms. My theory suggests that this material is somehow quantum-entangled with the crystal in the other platform, which enables swapping them including the surrounding platforms instantaneously. My theory also suggests that the reason the platforms ascend into the air before teleportation is that the crystals will swap all matter that is directly connected with them, up to the power of their energy.\n\nFurther research is needed to examine more platforms, and to verify my hypothesis that the teleportation distance depends on the size of this crystal, the material of which I have dubbed 'teleportanium'.";

Tomorrow I will visit the island to see the ancient ruins of Iliyara.\n\nDear Diary, the palace ruins are dope!\n\nDear Diary, lodging prices in the coastal village are beyond my budget for a prolonged stay, and on Main Iliyara Island camping is forbidden; I will try to find an alternative, maybe on one of the smaller islands around here.\n\nDear Diary, I have found a suitable place to stay on Little Iliyara Island. There are some ruins to be found here as well, but of course not comparable to those of the Palace and Acropolis of ancient Iliyara...\n\nDear Diary, this inconspicuous island houses teleportation platforms - right here, far away from Utraean lands, in the heart of the ancient Empire of Stars! Fascinating - were the Empires in closer contact than we previously knew? Did the Empire of Stars have their own platforms, could they maybe even build them themselves?\n\nDear Diary, as you know I have read about the theory of teleportanium, and I have examined enough displacers on the Utraean Peninsula and in Pentachoron Garden that I think it is true. But what I found here is mind-boggling: each of the small platforms here contains more teleportanium than the whole Utraean Peninsula combined! The crystals are big as an apple.\n\nDear Diary, the large platform consists almost completely of the crystal! My mind is blown but what does it mean? Could it be... but that would be incredible...\n\nDear Diary, after studying these things more and more and doing astrological calculations, I cannot help myself but conclude: these platforms lead to places further away than anyone can imagine - to other planets, and even the stars!\n\nDear Diary, I am afraid that after a millennium the displacers are out of order. Or maybe they require a different kind of Fire Mark that people no longer possess? Or maybe... I found some ancient artifacts in a little cave full of worms & spiders today. Tomorrow I want to see if they might be some kind of keys to the platform...";
