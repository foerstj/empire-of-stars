Granted, the ruins are nothing as famous as those on the main island - but I have found something astounding here... I might be so close to solving the most profound ancient mystery, and, you know me, I can hardly sleep from the goosebumps it gives me. I will write you more about it soon - I need to find proof, or the world will call me a nutcase.\n\nUntil then - take care,\nWith greetings & kisses, your one and only Aunt Luna";

The Utraeans of antiquity are the only people known for having built such platforms, although it must be said that our knowledge of the olden days is limited, and probably always will be.\n\nWhile the inner workings of the platform remain enigmatic, my research lets me conclude that there is one element they all have in common: a small mysterious crystal of unknown material, of about the size of a pinhead, that can be found embedded in all of these platforms. My theory suggests that this material is somehow quantum-entangled with the crystal in the other platform, which enables swapping them including the surrounding platforms instantaneously. My theory also suggests that the reason the platforms ascend into the air before teleportation is that the crystals will swap all matter that is directly connected with them, up to the power of their energy.\n\nFurther research is needed to examine more platforms, and to verify my hypothesis that the teleportation distance depends on the size of this crystal, the material of which I have dubbed 'teleportanium'.";

There are some ruins to be found here as well, but of course not comparable to those of the Palace and Acropolis of ancient Iliyara...\n\nDear Diary, I retract everything and claim the opposite: This inconspicuous island houses teleportation platforms - right here, far away from Utraean lands, in the heart of the ancient Empire of Stars! Could it all be true? I have believed it for years, but now I am afraid to hope too early. I need to find proof...\n\nDear Diary, as you know I have read about the theory of teleportanium, and I have examined enough displacers on the Utraean Peninsula and in Pentachoron Garden that I am sure it is true. And it all fits together: each of the small platforms here contains more teleportanium than the whole Utraean Peninsula combined, the crystals are big as apples. And the large platform consists almost entirely of the crystal! According to my astrological calculations, such a teleporter might really be strong enough to reach another star. I knew it! I knew it all the time! The Empire of Stars was in contact with other worlds from other stars, possibly spanning across several of them - an interstellar civilization in the prehistoric era! If I only knew how to operate them... My fear is that after a millennium they are simply out of order...\n\nDear Diary, today I explored the rest of the island, and in a cave full of worms and spiders I found two artifacts with star runes. I think they might be keys to activate the teleporter. Tomorrow I will try it out!";
