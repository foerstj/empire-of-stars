After visiting the half-sunken ruins of the Palace of Night, I now went to one of the smaller islands of Lake Chalice, and have arranged accomodation with a hermit loggerman who lives here. Granted, the ruins are nothing compared to the main island - but I have found something astounding here... I might be so close to solving an ancient mystery, and, you know me, I can hardly sleep from the goosebumps it gives me. I will write you more about it when I have had more time to examine it.\n\nUntil then - take care,\n\nWith greetings & kisses, your one and only Aunt Luna";

I've searched the whole island and could not find a trace of her.\n\nI have no idea of your situation or relationship, but I wanted to inform you of this strange disappearance; you are the only person she gave me contacts of, and if it is at all possible for you to travel here, I'd be happy to welcome you and help you solve this riddle if I can.\n\nGreetings,\n\nLoggerman from Little Iliyara Island, Lake Chalice.";
